# Suggestive Input using Tries and Recursion
A project to showcase a suggestive input which demonstrates the use of a trie data structure and recursion.

## To view the project
Very simply clone the repository, and then open the index.html file. 
Please be aware that the data does not persist between refreshes. It's a very basic application!

## The Mission
In order to solidify my understanding of recursion, I set out to create a real life application of the trie datastructure while using recursion to handle the construction of the trie itself.

While it looks basic and is not very exciting, I feel far more confident in using recursion now, which was my goal.
